It sold over four million copies worldwide and topped singles charts in \n         fourteen countries, including in the UK and United States. It was nominated for a Grammy Award and was \n         ranked number 384 on Rolling Stone\'s list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time".',path:e.p+"edc2128aadc6a143fae7.mp3"},{id:35,song_artist:"Guns N’Roses",song_name:"Knockin On Heaven Door",description:"Is a song by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, written for the soundtrack of the 1973\n       film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.
